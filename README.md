## 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses customer churn dataset  
- Trains a classification model (Logistic Regression / RandomForest / etc.)  
- Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualizes confusion matrix  

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PUVVALAOMPRAKASH/Customer-Churn-Predictor.git
cd Customer-Churn-Predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
▶️ Usage
Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```
📊 Example Output
Accuracy: ~81%
